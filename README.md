# Stellar Motion Project
## Overview
The "Stellar Motion" project aims to calculate the observed wavelength of the hydrogen alpha line for the star HD94028 and compare it to the known wavelength of hydrogen absorption. By doing so, we can determine the star's radial velocity and understand how fast it is moving away from the Earth. This project is implemented using MATLAB and utilizes spectral analysis techniques.

## Usage
Ensure you have the required spectral data of HD94028 and the known wavelength of the hydrogen alpha line.

Open the MATLAB script stellar_motion_analysis.m.

Update the file paths and constants in the script according to your data.

Run the script in MATLAB.

## Methodology
Load the spectral data of HD94028.

Identify the location of the observed hydrogen alpha line in the spectrum.

Calculate the observed wavelength of the hydrogen alpha line.

Compare the observed wavelength with the known wavelength of hydrogen absorption.

Calculate the star's radial velocity using the Doppler shift formula.

Results
The script will output the observed wavelength of the hydrogen alpha line, the comparison with the known wavelength, and the calculated radial velocity of HD94028.
