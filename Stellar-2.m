%{Line 2 of the script extracts the spectrum data for the second star in the matrix spectra. Then lines 3â€“5 calculate the speed based on that data.%}

[sHa,idx] = min(spectra);
lambdaHa = lambda(idx);
z = lambdaHa/656.28 - 1;
speed = z*299792.458

%{Notice that speed is now a vector. A positive speed means that the star is moving away from Earth (redshifted spectrum), and a negative speed means that the star is moving toward Earth (blueshifted spectrum).%}
%{plot the spectra of all seven stars using different line properties for redshifted and blueshifted spectra. It is convenient to use a for loop to access each star's data one at a time.%}

    s= spectra(:,v)
    if speed(v)<=0
        plot(lambda,s,"--")

%{In the plot, you identify stars with redshifted spectra by using their line styles, and then look up their names in the legend.%}
